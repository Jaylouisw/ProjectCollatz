## Versioning Strategy

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version for backward-compatible functionality additions
- **PATCH** version for backward-compatible bug fixes

### Version 1.0.1 Classification
This is a **MINOR** version bump because:
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ New features are additive, not breaking
- ✅ Configuration migration is automatic
- ✅ Old interfaces continue working

The extensive future-proofing additions warrant a significant version bump while maintaining full compatibility with existing deployments.
