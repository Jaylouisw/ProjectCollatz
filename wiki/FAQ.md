# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## 🤔 General Questions

### What is the Collatz Conjecture?
The Collatz Conjecture is one of mathematics' most famous unsolved problems. For any positive integer:
- If it's even, divide by 2
- If it's odd, multiply by 3 and add 1
- Repeat until you reach 1

**Example**: 7 → 22 → 11 → 34 → 17 → 52 → 26 → 13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1

The conjecture states that **every** positive integer eventually reaches 1. Despite extensive testing, no counterexample has been found, but no mathematical proof exists.
