# Security Architecture & Audit Invitation

## Current Implementation Status

**ProjectCollatz is in alpha development.** This document honestly outlines our security architecture, what's implemented, what's planned, and where we need expert review.

## Implemented Security Features

### 1. **Decentralized Architecture (IPFS)**
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Description**: Work units and results are distributed via IPFS, eliminating single points of control
- **How it works**: 
  - Each node publishes its state to IPFS
  - Nodes discover peers via IPFS DHT
  - No central server can manipulate work assignments
- **Limitations**: IPFS itself has known security considerations (Sybil attacks, eclipse attacks)

### 2. **Cryptographic Proof Hashing**
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Description**: Each work unit and result includes SHA-256 cryptographic proof
- **How it works**:
  ```python
  proof_data = {
      'assignment_id': assignment_id,
      'range_start': start,
      'range_end': end,
      'timestamp': timestamp,
      'worker_id': worker_id
  }
  proof_hash = hashlib.sha256(json.dumps(proof_data, sort_keys=True).encode()).hexdigest()
  ```
- **Guarantees**: Work units are tamper-evident; any modification changes the hash
- **Limitations**: Does not prevent malicious work generation, only detects tampering

### 3. **Worker Identity & Reputation**
- **Status**: ✅ Basic implementation
- **Description**: Workers are tracked by cryptographic keypairs and maintain reputation scores
- **How it works**:
  - Each worker has an Ed25519 keypair
  - Work submissions are signed with private key
  - Reputation tracks verified contributions
- **Limitations**: 
  - No Proof-of-Work or stake requirements (Sybil attack vector)
  - Reputation can be farmed by correctly verifying easy ranges

### 4. **Result Verification Redundancy**
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Description**: Critical results require multiple independent verifications
- **How it works**:
  - Results near boundaries (2^68+) require 3+ independent verifications
  - Random sampling verification (10% of all submissions)
  - Coordinator maintains verification requirements per range
- **Guarantees**: Reduces single-point-of-failure for critical discoveries
- **Limitations**: Coordination happens via consensus, not cryptographic proof

## Security Features In Development

### 5. **Anti-Self-Verification** ⚠️
- **Status**: 🚧 Partially Implemented
- **Current Implementation**:
  ```python
  def assign_work(self, worker_id: str) -> dict:
      # Workers cannot verify their own assignments
      for assignment_id, assignment in self.active_assignments.items():
          if assignment['worker_id'] != worker_id:
              # Can verify others' work
              ...
  ```
- **Limitations**:
  - Workers can still create multiple identities (Sybil attack)
  - No cryptographic proof enforcing this at protocol level
- **Planned Improvements**:
  - Introduce computational proof-of-work for worker registration
  - Implement stake-based verification rights
  - Add mandatory cooling-off period between assignment and verification

### 6. **Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)** ⚠️
- **Status**: 🚧 Design Phase
- **Goal**: Tolerate up to 1/3 malicious nodes
- **Current Approach**: Consensus voting on canonical state
- **Gaps**:
  - No formal BFT protocol (PBFT, Tendermint, etc.)
  - Voting mechanism not cryptographically enforced
  - No slashing for provably malicious behavior
- **Planned Improvements**:
  - Implement modified PBFT for work assignment consensus
  - Add stake/reputation slashing for dishonest nodes
  - Cryptographic proofs for all state transitions

### 7. **Work Integrity Verification** ⚠️
- **Status**: 🚧 Basic checks only
- **Current Implementation**: Hash-based integrity only
- **Missing**:
  - Zero-knowledge proofs for efficient result verification
  - Probabilistic checking (succinct proofs)
  - Deterministic replay verification
- **Planned**: Research integration of zkSNARKs for proof compression

## Security Vulnerabilities & Known Risks

### Critical Risks

1. **Sybil Attacks**
   - **Risk**: Attacker creates many fake worker identities to control consensus
   - **Mitigation Status**: ⚠️ Minimal (reputation tracking only)
   - **Planned**: Proof-of-work for identity creation, stake requirements

2. **Eclipse Attacks**
   - **Risk**: Attacker isolates a node by surrounding it with malicious peers
   - **Mitigation Status**: ❌ None (relies on IPFS DHT)
   - **Planned**: Diverse peer discovery mechanisms, trusted bootstrap nodes

3. **Malicious Work Assignment**
   - **Risk**: Coordinator can assign overlapping or useless ranges
   - **Mitigation Status**: ✅ Partial (work state is transparent on IPFS)
   - **Limitation**: Workers must actively audit work queue

4. **Result Forgery**
   - **Risk**: Worker claims to have verified range without actual computation
   - **Mitigation Status**: ✅ Redundant verification catches this
   - **Limitation**: Requires honest majority of verifiers

5. **Denial of Service**
   - **Risk**: Flood network with spam work units or invalid results
   - **Mitigation Status**: ⚠️ Basic rate limiting
   - **Planned**: Stake-based submission rights, reputation requirements

### Moderate Risks

6. **Timestamp Manipulation**
   - **Risk**: Workers forge timestamps to gain priority
   - **Mitigation Status**: ✅ Coordinator validates timestamp reasonableness
   - **Limitation**: No cryptographic time-stamping (e.g., blockchain anchoring)

7. **Private Key Compromise**
   - **Risk**: Worker private keys leaked or stolen
   - **Mitigation Status**: ⚠️ Standard file permissions
   - **Planned**: Hardware security module (HSM) support, key rotation

- **Network Adversary**: Adversary can monitor but not block all network traffic
- **Computational Bounds**: Adversary cannot break SHA-256 or Ed25519 in polynomial time

### Attack Scenarios Considered

   - **Status**: Vulnerable (relies on honest majority assumption)
2. **Long-Range Attack**: Attacker rewrites verification history
   - **Status**: Partially mitigated (IPFS content-addressing)
3. **Front-Running**: Attacker sees counterexample and claims credit
   - **Status**: Mitigated (timestamp-based ordering, first-submission wins)
