## Project Status

### Currently Implemented

**Core Functionality:**
- CPU Verification - Multi-threaded Collatz verification engine
- GPU Acceleration - CUDA support for NVIDIA GPUs (10-100x speedup)
- IPFS Coordination - Decentralized work distribution via IPFS
- User Accounts - Persistent identity with Ed25519 key pairs

**Security Features:**
- Ed25519 Signatures - Cryptographic signing of verification results
- Content Addressing - IPFS hash-based integrity
- Public Verification - All results published to IPFS
- Worker Identity - Unique peer IDs for tracking

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for complete security assessment.

### In Development

- Multi-Verifier Consensus - Framework exists, needs wider testing
- Trust/Reputation System - Basic scoring implemented, Byzantine tolerance in progress
- Anti-Self-Verification - Design complete, enforcement testing

### Planned

- Independent Security Audit - Seeking security researchers
- Byzantine Fault Tolerance - Full BFT consensus for untrusted networks
- Web Interface - Browser-based worker participation
- AMD GPU Support - ROCm acceleration
- Mobile Apps - iOS/Android clients

See [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md) for protocol evolution roadmap.

### Known Limitations

- **No Independent Audit**: Project has not undergone professional security review
- **Alpha Software**: Expect bugs, breaking changes, incomplete features
- **Small Network**: Limited nodes reduce Byzantine fault tolerance
- **Trust Model**: Relies on honest majority assumption

**Status:** Research/educational project exploring distributed verification. Treat results as experimental.

## Usage

### Interactive Mode (Recommended)

```bash
python network_launcher.py
```

Menu:
1. Create User Account - Generate identity keypair
2. Start Worker - Join network and begin computing
3. View Statistics - See contribution metrics
4. View Leaderboard - Check global rankings

### Direct Worker Mode

For automation or multi-node setups:

```bash
# Run with user key
python distributed_collatz.py --user-key ./keys/username_private_key.pem

# Multiple nodes under one account
python distributed_collatz.py --user-key ./keys/alice.pem --name node1
python distributed_collatz.py --user-key ./keys/alice.pem --name node2
python distributed_collatz.py --user-key ./keys/alice.pem --name node3
```

### GPU Acceleration

For 10x-100x speedup, install CUDA:

```bash
# CUDA 12.x
pip install cupy-cuda12x

# CUDA 11.x
pip install cupy-cuda11x
```

GPU will be auto-detected on startup.

## How It Works

### The Collatz Conjecture

Algorithm:
- If n is even: n â†’ n/2
- If n is odd: n â†’ 3n+1
- Repeat until reaching 1

**Conjecture:** This process always reaches 1 for any positive integer.

**Status:** Unproven. Verified computationally up to 2^68.

**Goal:** Extend verification with cryptographically-signed records.

### Distributed Network

Architecture:
1. **Work Generation** - Network automatically creates verification tasks
2. **Random Assignment** - Workers randomly selected to prevent collusion
3. **Verification** - Independent verification by assigned workers
4. **Consensus** - Framework for multi-worker agreement (in development)
5. **Publication** - Cryptographically signed results stored on IPFS
6. **Trust Building** - Reputation system tracks worker consistency

### IPFS Implementation

Benefits:
- **Decentralized** - No single point of failure
- **Permanent** - Content-addressed storage
- **Tamper-proof** - Cryptographic hashing
- **Global** - Independent verification capability
